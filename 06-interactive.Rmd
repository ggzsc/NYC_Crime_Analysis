# Interactive component

The goal of this chapter is to produce an interactive plot indicating the increase of hate crime events against race, specifically Asian, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected the data from 2020 to 2021 in the NYC hate crime data set and four races of Asian, Black, Hispanic and White to do comparison. 

From the plot, it is obvious that there is a sharp increase of Anti-Asian hate crimes in the New York City during the pandemic. It might be resulted from COVID-19 stigma and misinformation, such as slurs like "Kung Flu" and "China virus" as well as the lab-leak hypothesis.

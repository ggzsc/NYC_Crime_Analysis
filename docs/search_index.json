The problem with this data set lies in processing it ready for our analysis, since it might involve irrelevant information, missing values and unclear structure.

The only problem with it is missing values.

Then, we took out observations associated with the suspects information, since this project is more focus on the victims perspective. We also eliminated police abbreviations and codes to make this report reader-friendly. 3.1.1.1 Selected Variables Id for the reported event Exact date and time of crime event Description of offense: burglary, forgery, robbery, etc. Crime status: completed or attempted Level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation The name of the borough in which the incident occurred Specific location of the reported crime: grocery store, residence, street, etc. Race of victim Sex of victim Latitude and Longitude of the location where the crime took place 3.1.2 Transformation Steps Selected the top 10 offenses Selected the top 10 specific locations Created a new month number column Added a new weekday column Converted the exact time of crime occurrence from the HH:MM:SS format to an interval value defining a period of time in hours This cleaning process reduced the size of the original data set significantly and made analysis more efficient. 3.2 Hate crime data 3.2.1 Variable Selection For this relatively small and neat data set, we only took out a few features, including police terminology, arrest date and arrest ID. 3.2.1.1 Selected Variables Year of the complaint Month of the complaint County name Level of offense Offense category: race, gender, religion, etc. Bias motive description: Anti-Asian, Anti-Transgender, Anti-Muslim, etc. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Missing data would substantially affect the precision of the analysis and could lead to wrong prediction as well as conclusion. In this chapter, we examined the missing data in the two data sets. However, after data cleaning and transformation, there is no missing value in the hate crime data set. Consequently, we mainly focused on the missing values in the crime data set. From the plot above, it is recognizable that most cases are complete, with no missing value. Location, County and Offense are the three most apparent missing features among 10. They have 1,104, 463 and 5 missing rows respectively. We took another step to analyze the significance of these missing variables and presented it in the following plot. In this large data set containing over 40K rows, the percentages of missing Location and County rows are both less than 0.3%, and offense is not even noticeable. In this way, we concluded that the existence of missing values in this data set does not have significant statistical power of producing biased results.

Conversely, Staten Island has the lowest. The distribution of the number of crimes has a similar shape regardless of the level of offense across time periods. What is more, crimes categorized as misdemeanor are committed the most among those three levels. Brooklyn has the largest number of crimes in all levels and Staten Island has the lowest. Manhattan has the smallest number of crimes defined as violation. Bronx seems to have a similar distribution of crimes as that of Queens. 5.2 Hate Crime Analysis Kings(Brooklyn) has the highest number of hate crime events in general, followed by New York(Manhattan) and Queens; Richmond(Staten Island) has the lowest. Among these bias motivations, Anti-Jewish appears to be the most common one. Moreover, from the perspective of hate crimes against sexual orientation, Anti-Male homosexual is the most severe one. In order to further examine it, we picked the top five bias motivations, including Anti-Jewish, Anti-Asian, Anti-Male homosexual, Anti-BLACK and Anti-White, and presented the number of motivations by borough in the following graph. From this plot, it is apparent that Anti-Jewish hate crimes occurred the most in Kings. Anti-Asian, Anti-Male homosexual, Anti-Black and Anti-White hate crimes are all committed the most in New York. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The goal of this chapter is to produce an interactive plot indicating the increase of hate crime events against race, specifically Asian, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected the data from 2020 to 2021 in the NYC hate crime data set and four races of Asian, Black, Hispanic and White to do comparison. From the plot, it is obvious that there is a sharp increase of Anti-Asian hate crimes in the New York City during the pandemic. It might be resulted from COVID-19 stigma and misinformation, such as slurs like Kung Flu and China virus as well as the lab-leak hypothesis. Click here to view the interactive plot.

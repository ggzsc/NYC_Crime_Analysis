We also eliminated police abbreviations and codes to make this report reader-friendly. 3.1.1.1 Selected Variables Id for the reported event Exact date and time of crime event Description of offense: burglary, forgery, robbery, etc. Crime status: completed or attempted Level of offense: felony, misdemeanor, violation The name of the borough in which the incident occurred Specific location of the reported crime: grocery store, residence, street, etc. Race of victim Sex of victim Latitude and Longitude of the location where the crime took place 3.1.2 Transformation Steps Selected the top 10 offenses Selected the top 10 specific locations Created a new month number column Added a new weekday column Converted the exact time of crime occurrence from the HH:MM:SS format to an interval value defining a period of time in hours This cleaning process reduced the size of the original data set significantly and made analysis more efficient. 3.2 NYC Hate Crime Data 3.2.1 Variable Selection For this relatively small and neat data set, we only took out a few features, including police terminology and arrest ID.
